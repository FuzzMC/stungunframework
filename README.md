# stungunframework
Just a script that AI helped me make. It took some time to fix errors with the criteria I had asked for. If there are any errors, please let me know. I will most likely ask the AI to fix it, because I'm not the best at coding, just key-word reading. Also I haven't been able to actually test it.

# **NOTE:**
I don't have much knowledge on coding, so if you have an error to cite just tell me what's wrong with it and I'll work with the AI to fix it.
Also, neither am I able to test it, long story, don't want to explain, so expect some features not working.

# **INSTALLATION:**
Installation is simple, just go to your CFXDefaultFiveM folder (Mine's in txData) and put it in your resources folder. It doesn't matter if you organize it into another folder, as long as the folder is like this: [Folder Name].

# **WHAT IT CONTAINS (HOPEFULLY):**
-Laser (cannot be toggled)
-Flashlight (cannot be toggled)
-ON/OFF Functionality using "X" (Triggers notification saying "Powered ON/OFF")
-2 Cartridge Limit, can be refilled using a command /refillcart inside of a vehicle (Any Vehicle)
-Prong Physics, for example, hitting someone with a prong and being able to tase them again after a wait (Triggers notification saying "Suspect Hit!")
-Following Prong Physics, it can only be removed by doing the following: Pressing "I" when close enough; Too far away from the suspect; Or reloaded; (When removing prong, give notification saying "Prong was removed!")
-Manual Reload (Need to press R)
-Reload Animation
-Removed Charge Bar and made it ammo
